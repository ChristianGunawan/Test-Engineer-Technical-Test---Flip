1. Current air pollution of Jakarta Selatan using Java Karate
2. UI automation testing using Selenium

## Prerequisites

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository:**
> git clone https://github.com/your-username/flip-recruitment-exercise.git

## Chapter 1: Freeedom of Speech
1. Tell us about the most challenging bug you encountered and how you resolved it.

- When the application was live, there was a crash when visiting the shop during an ongoing event. I immediately checked both the front end and back end and discovered that the issue was due to a versioning error. I quickly fixed the versioning issue and verified the fix across several affected versions.

3. How do you stay updated with the latest trends in software testing? Please provide examples of how you applied new knowledge or techniques in your work.

- I stay updated by following industry blogs, LinkedIn, and YouTube channels. Recently, I learned about shift-left testing from a blog and applied it in my projects, reducing bugs in early development stages. I also used new techniques from YouTube tutorials to enhance UI automation with Cypress.


3. If you were the only QA in your team, how would you collaborate with devs and PM so that the lack of manpower does not affect the outcome?

- As the only QA, I would ensure clear communication with devs and PMs via regular meetings and updates. I'd prioritize tasks, maintain thorough documentation, and implement Selenium for UI automation to maximize efficiency. Collaborative tools like Jira would streamline our workflow.
